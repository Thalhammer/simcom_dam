# Modem Information
## Hardware
Simcom's SIM7000E module seems to be based on the [MDM9206](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mdm9206-iot-modem) chip produced by qualcomm. It's however really hard to get any information or datasheet from qualcomm (trust me, I tried) without having a company and signing lots of NDAs. However there is some information and headers provided by simcom. Some features include:

* Support for LTE CAT-M1 and CAT-NB1 (or how marketing calls it:5G)
* Support for E-GPRS (2G) for regions where 5G is not available
* Support for GPS, GLONASS, Beidou and soon Galileo
* Builtin ARM Cortex A7 with up to 1.3GHz
* 1 Fully usable UART
* TX only UART
* Builtin TCP/IP, MQTT, HTTP, CoAP, LWM2M stacks
* Operational directly form single cell lipo
* Builtin LDO regulator to supply external electronics
* &gt;16MB flash filesystem
* Embedded OS with support for threading, memory management, etc (ThreadX ?)

## Software
As far as I know the firmware is based on ThreadX, however the bootlog that gets dumped on pin 23 during startup suggests it's a linux system.
All interaction is done through a mechanism similar to syscalls.
