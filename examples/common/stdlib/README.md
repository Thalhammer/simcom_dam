# Basic stdlib implementation

This folder provides a basic stdlib implementation of commonly used functions. It provides by no means a full and standard compliant
stdlib, so if you need one you might want to replace it with something like newlib. However I don't need a full C lib so I choose to
implement anything needed for those examples on my own in order to keep dependencies down.
