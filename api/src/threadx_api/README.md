# txm_lib.lib and timer_dam_lib.lib rewrite

This folder contains a reimplementation of those functions provided in txm_lib.lib in order to allow more options
when choosing compilers and compile options. I do not have access to sourcecode of ThreadX
so all of this based on reverse engineering the provided libraries. This means work in this directory is in no way supported
by Express Logic or guaranteed to be correct. But I do my best to make sure they are error free.
